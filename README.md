### Capstone Project
* Name of project
** Resume Builder
* Purpose
** To practice the idea of modernizing practices, we created an application that would use a form to create a resume, where a user can choose a template amongst a list of different templates based on their career of choice.
* What did you build, your contributions, tech / languages you used
** I used Java for the backend and built the models, domain, controller, exception handler, and repository package using spring boot framework. On the front end I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Node.JS, React, and Bootstrap framework. To communicate with the backend, I built a custom API to send and receive data from the backend. I connected to a database using Spring Boot JDBC, and built the database using SQL workbench with Docker containers and created the necessary tables which had different types of relationships. Throughout the process of creating the application I used Github to manage version controls.
